## Project Overview
- **Type**: [e.g., Next.js 15 web app, Express API, React Native mobile app]
- **Stack**: [e.g., TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL]
- **Architecture**: [e.g., App Router, REST API, Monorepo]

## Code Style
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Prefer functional components and hooks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

## File Structure
- Components: `src/components/`

- Tests: Next to source files or in `tests/`

## Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use [Jest/Vitest/Pytest] for testing
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Security Rules
- NEVER hardcode secrets or API keys
- ALWAYS validate user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS

## Git Workflow
- Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:
- Create descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits small and focused

## Common Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Production build
npm run test     # Run tests
npm run lint     # Run linter
```

## When Making Changes
1. Understand the existing code first
